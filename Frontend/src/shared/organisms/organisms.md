## organisms
Molecules give us some building blocks to work with, and we can now combine them together to 
form organisms. Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex,
distinct section of an interface.

We’re starting to get increasingly concrete. A client might not be terribly interested in the
molecules of a design system, but with organisms we can see the final interface beginning to
take shape. Dan Mall (who I’m working with on several projects) uses element collages, which
articulate ideas for a few key organisms to facilitate client conversations and shape the visual
direction (all without having to construct full comps).

Organisms can consist of similar and/or different molecule types. For example, a masthead
organism might consist of diverse components like a logo, primary navigation, search form,
and list of social media channels. But a “product grid” organism might consist of the same
molecule (possibly containing a product image, product title and price) repeated over and
over again.

Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating standalone, portable, reusable components.
