## Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real
representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.

Pages are the highest level of fidelity and because they’re the most tangible, it’s typically 
where most people in the process spend most of their time and what most reviews revolve around.

The page stage is essential as it’s where we test the effectiveness of the design system. 
Viewing everything in context allows us to loop back to modify our molecules, organisms, and 
templates to better address the real context of the design.

Pages are also the place to test variations in templates. For example, you might want to 
articulate what a headline containing 40 characters looks like, but also demonstrate what 340 
characters looks like. What does it look like when a user has one item in their shopping cart 
versus 10 items with a discount code applied? Again, these specific instances influence how we 
loop back through and construct our system.
