## Templates

At the template stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense 
to our clients and our final output. Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched
together to form pages. Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing
things like layout in action.
  
Templates are very concrete and provide context to all these relatively abstract molecules and
organisms. Templates are also where clients start seeing the final design in place. In my experience
working with this methodology, templates begin their life as HTML wireframes, but over time increase
fidelity to ultimately become the final deliverable. Bearded Studio in Pittsburgh follow a similar
process, where designs start grayscale and layout-less but slowly increase fidelity until the final
design is in place.
